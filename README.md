A macOS focus app that helps you stay on track by setting one intention per session.

## How it works

1. Set your intention when you sit down at your computer
2. A persistent overlay keeps your focus visible while you work
3. End the session and mark it as a win or loss
4. Build a log of your sessions over time

## Philosophy

Stay aware of your intentions to avoid distractions. No todo manager needed—just focus on winning each session, one thing at a time.

## Features

- **No sign in required** - Start using immediately
- **Privacy first** - Sessions stored locally as markdown files
